# **Why each element is added:**


* **Load balancer cluster:** The load balancer cluster is added to provide high availability and scalability for the load balancing. This ensures that the website is always available, even if one of the load balancers fails.


* **Split components:** The components are split onto their own servers to improve performance and security. This allows each component to be scaled independently, and it also reduces the risk of a single component failure taking down the entire website.
